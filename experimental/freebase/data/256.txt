When the Cat's Away (French: Chacun cherche son chat) is a 1996 French drama directed by Cédric Klapisch. The movie is setting in Paris and stars Garance Clavel, Zinedine Soualem, Renée Le Calm, Olivier Py, Romain Duris, Hélène de Fougerolles and others. This is the story of a young woman living in Paris, and more particularly in the Bastille neighborhood, who has lost her cat. Through the pursuit of the cat, the film allows the spectator to discover the contrasts of the district, which is evolving from a typical Parisian district to a modern and young district, and the contrast between its inhabitants, among them a nice simpleton and the old women who are bored. In fact it’s the story of a village in a large city and Cédric Klapisch shows once again the behaviour of one individual inside a group, as he did it in Le péril jeune or Riens du tout. This time he has succeeded in joining together actors, theatre actors and residents of the district, creating a credible atmosphere and that is probably the reason for the success of this film outside France.
