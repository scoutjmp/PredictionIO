(See main article Martin Guerre). The film relates an historical case of identity theft. Martin Guerre leaves his young wife in a small French village to go fight in a war and travel. Many years later, a man claiming to be Martin returns to resume his life.

The story ends with the man's trial. In 1983, a book of the same name was published by Natalie Zemon Davis, an American historian of early modern France. She had served as a consultant and helped write the screenplay for the film. She was a professor at Princeton University. Sommersby was a 1993 United States remake of the film, set after the American Civil War and starring Richard Gere and Jodie Foster.
