Full Speed (Italian: Tempo massimo) is a 1934 Italian comedy film directed by Mario Mattoli on his debut. The final scene showing Giacomo and Dora, after having avoided the "wrong" marriage, in the back of the bus as it travels down the road, is practically the same scene as the ending of Mike Nichols's The Graduate.
