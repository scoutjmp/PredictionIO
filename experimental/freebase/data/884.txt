Year of the Horse (1997)
/m/066d6g
Year of the Horse is a 1997 documentary directed by Jim Jarmusch following Neil Young and Crazy Horse on their 1996 tour. Year of the Horse is also a live album by Neil Young & Crazy Horse released in 1997. It offers a different track list than the film. This live album, in many ways could be seen as an epitaph for longtime Neil Young producer David Briggs who died in 1995 from lung cancer. This is reflected by the song choices which (outside of recent album cuts like "Scattered" and "Big Time") were among Briggs' favorites. All songs were written by Neil Young.
