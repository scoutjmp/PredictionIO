/m/0586x1
Murder in the First is a largely fictitious 1995 film, directed by Marc Rocco, about a petty criminal named Henri Young (portrayed by Kevin Bacon) who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. The film stars Christian Slater, Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman. As a 17-year-old orphan, Henri Young steals $5.00 from a grocery store to feed himself and his little sister, both of whom are destitute. He is apprehended by the store clerk, and his sister is sent to an orphanage. Because the store Young robs houses a U.S. Post Office, his crime becomes a federal offense. Young never sees his sister again and is sentenced to Leavenworth Penitentiary, Kansas. After later being transferred to Alcatraz, he participates in an escape attempt with two other prisoners. The escape plan fails due to the betrayal of a fellow inmate, Rufus McCain. Young is sent to solitary confinement in "the hole", where, except for 30 minutes on Christmas Day, 1940, he is left for three years. During this extraordinarily long period of time spent in solitary confinement, Young slowly begins to lose his sanity. Upon being released from solitary confinement, he experiences a psychotic episode in the prison cafeteria
