/m/02mkwj
Bad Taste is a 1987 cult science fiction comedy horror film produced, edited, cinematographied, written, directed and starring Peter Jackson, who also made all special effects on the film. Produced on a low budget, it is Jackson's first feature film. The film stars Jackson and his friends taking a number of key roles, both on and off-screen. The plotline sees aliens invade the fictional New Zealand village of Kaihoro to harvest humans for their intergalactic fast food franchise, where they face off against a four-man paramilitary force, of which at least one member appears to have gone insane. It was a film that provided Peter Jackson with the necessary leverage needed to advance in the industry. The Astro Investigation and Defence Service (AIDS) sends Derek (Peter Jackson), Frank, Ozzy, and Barry to investigate the disappearance of everyone in the town of Kaihoro, New Zealand. They find the town has been overrun by space aliens disguised as humans. Barry kills one of the aliens and is attacked by others. After Derek notifies Frank and Ozzy, he begins torturing Robert (also played by Jackson), an alien they caught earlier. Robert's screaming attracts a number of aliens in the area.
