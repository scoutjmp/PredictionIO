The Night Flier is a 1997 film based on the short story of the same name which was written by Stephen King. It was directed by Mark Pavia and starred Miguel Ferrer and Julie Entwisle. The story follows a reporter named Richard Dees as he attempts to follow and catch up with a murderer who kills his victims in a vampiristic style, and who seemingly flies to each murder scene by plane, a black Skymaster. The plot culminates in Dees' confrontation with 'The Night Flier' and his own loss of sanity. Dees' nemesis is a young female reporter who joins the staff at the exploitative magazine "Inside View", where he ranks as senior reporter. She at first is dismissed by him as naive and at best a "Jimmy", as in "Jimmy Olsen", then is actively abused by him. She ultimately survives him and writes about Dees' death, prominently featured on the title page of the magazine "Inside View". The Night Flier contains many references to Stephen King's larger mythos, most of which were not present in the original story. In the scene where Katherine looks at some of Richard's previous Inside View articles, we see that most of the bylines relate to other Stephen King stories. 'Springheel Jack Strikes
