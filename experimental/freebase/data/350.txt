Fallen is a 1998 supernatural thriller film, directed by Gregory Hoblit, and starring Denzel Washington, John Goodman and Donald Sutherland. The film opens with Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) struggling and gasping for breath in a snow-ridden forest, with his voice overdubbing in a narration-style, saying "Let me tell you about the time I almost died." In the present day, Hobbes gains notoriety for capturing serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas).

Hobbes is skeptical of Azazel's claims until the demon begins to sing "Time Is on My Side", then begins to possess people via
