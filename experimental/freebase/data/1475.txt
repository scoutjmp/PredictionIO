Bhaji on the Beach is a 1993 film by director Gurinder Chadha with a screenplay by Meera Syal. A diverse group of British women of South Asian descent go on a day trip to the beach in Blackpool; despite their differences—the older women are more traditional and conservative, the younger women more Westernized—they eventually manage to see common ground. The very concept of generation gap is effectively showcased by the movie. Bhaji is a term used for an elder sister out of respect.
