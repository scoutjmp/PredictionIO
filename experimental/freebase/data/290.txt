Fierce Creatures is a 1997 comedy film. Although not a sequel, it was a follow-up to the wildly popular A Fish Called Wanda, starring the same four actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. The movie was written by John Cleese and directed by Fred Schepisi and Robert Young. The story is centred on a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain (played by Kevin Kline) and put under the management of Rollo Lee (Cleese).

The story centres around Marwood Zoo (named after John Marwood Cleese, and also very similar to a real life zoo used for filming, Marwell) that has recently been acquired by Octopus Inc., a corporation run by CEO Rod McCain (Kevin Kline), the most powerful man alive. Octopus Inc. requires that all its investments return a 20% profit margin. Retired British Hong Kong policeman Rollo Lee (John Cleese) is put in
