Caught (1949) is an American film noir starring James Mason, Barbara Bel Geddes and Robert Ryan. Child actor Jimmy Hawkins had a small role in the film. Caught was directed by Max Ophuls and was based on a novel by Libbie Block. The film is available on DVD. Young model Leonora Eames (Bel Geddes) weds multimillionaire Smith Ohlrig (Ryan). Ohlrig is deranged and did not marry for love. Eames insists several times that she married for love, but the film suggests that she is deluding herself. When Ohlrig becomes too abusive, she leave penniless, finds a job at a medical clinic in a poor neighborhood and eventually falls for Dr. Larry Quinada (Mason). During a one-night reconciliation with Ohlrigh, she becomes pregnant. In Block's novel, the character of Smith Ohlrig is based on Howard Hughes. She depicts him as a cruel narcissist, a characterization that Ophuls exaggerates in his film. Ophuls and Hughes were on unfriendly terms. In 1946, Ophuls and Preston Sturges had been fired by Hughes during shooting of Vendetta, finally released in 1950 by RKO Radio Pictures. Caught is considered his revenge against Hughes exacted vicariously through Ryan's character.
