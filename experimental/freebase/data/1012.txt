Private Parts is a 1997 American biographical comedy film produced by Ivan Reitman and released by Paramount Pictures. Written by Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko, the film is an adaptation of the 1993 best-selling book of the same name by radio personality Howard Stern, who stars as himself. It follows his life from boyhood to the cusp of break-out success in radio. His radio show staff also star in the film, including newscaster and co-host Robin Quivers, producers Fred Norris and Gary Dell'Abate and comedian Jackie Martling. Development began after Stern, who insisted on script approval, rejected multiple write-ups. Filming started in May 1996 and lasted for four months, with director Betty Thomas. Private Parts was first screened on February 27, 1997 in New York City, followed by a general release in the United States on March 3. It topped the box office in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million. It went on to earn $41.2 million in domestic revenue overall. In 1998, the film was released on DVD and Stern won a Blockbuster Award for Favorite Male Newcomer. In recent years the film has aired on cable television channels USA Network and Universal HD.
