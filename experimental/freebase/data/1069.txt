/m/0858d3
Amateur is a 1994 film written and directed by Hal Hartley starring Isabelle Huppert, Martin Donovan and Elina LÃ¶wensohn. The title is also an acronym, encompassing elements of the film Donovan plays Thomas, an amnesiac trying to put his life back together, who meets an ex-nun (Huppert) writing pornographic stories. The scenes of overt violence were new territory for Hartley, but the film was still in his usual deadpan and dialogue-driven style. The soundtrack features excerpts from various alternative artists: The soundtrack also included original music by "Ned Rifle" (a pseudonym used by Hal Hartley) and Jeff Taylor. It was released by Matador Records.
