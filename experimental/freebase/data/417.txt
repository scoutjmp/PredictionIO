Parent Trap, The (1961)
/m/06y611
The Parent Trap is a 1998 remake of the 1961 family film of the same name. It was directed and co-written by Nancy Meyers, and produced and co-written by Charles Shyer. It stars Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson as a couple who divorce soon after marrying, and Lindsay Lohan in a dual role as their twin daughters, who are accidentally reunited after being separated at birth. Both films are based on Erich KÃ¤stner's novel Lottie and Lisa (Das doppelte Lottchen). The novel and the 1936 Deanna Durbin film Three Smart Girls are the basis of the screenplay written by David Swift for the 1961 and 1998 film, only the novel is credited however. Meyers and Shyer are credited as co-writers of the 1998 version along with Swift. Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) and Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) met and married each other during an ocean cruise on the QE2 (Queen Elizabeth 2). Elizabeth gave birth to twin daughters Hallie and Annie (both played by Lohan), but the couple divorced and lost contact with each other, each parent raising one of the twins without telling her about her sister. Nick raised Hallie in the Napa Valley and became a wealthy wine grower, while Elizabeth raised Annie in London
