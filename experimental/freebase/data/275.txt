/m/011yg9
Sense and Sensibility is a 1995 British period drama film directed by Taiwanese-American director Ang Lee. The screenplay by Emma Thompson is based on the 1811 novel of the same name by English author Jane Austen. The film stars Thompson and Kate Winslet as the two eldest Dashwood sisters, while actors Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman play their respective suitors. Producer Lindsay Doran, a longtime admirer of Austen's novel, hired Thompson to write the screenplay. The actress spent four years going through numerous revisions, as she worked on the script between other films as well as into production of the film itself. Whilst initially intending for another actress to portray Elinor Dashwood, Lee convinced Thompson to undertake the part herself. Sense and Sensibility contributed to a resurgence in popularity for Austen's work, and led to many more film and television adaptations in the following years. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release, and many awards and nominations. It was nominated for eleven British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA Awards), winning the top award BAFTA Award for Best Film, with Thompson and Winslet both winning the BAFTA Award for Best
