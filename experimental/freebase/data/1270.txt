Life with Mikey (also known as Give Me a Break) is a 1993 comedy film starring Michael J. Fox, Christina Vidal, Nathan Lane, Cyndi Lauper and David Krumholtz. Tagline: He's a talent agent. She's a thief. Looks like they've already got something in common. Mikey Chapman (Michael J. Fox), a former child star and now a talent agent for child stars, discovers Angie Vega (Christina Vidal, in her first movie), a girl who pick-pockets for money and lives with her teenage sister and her boyfriend. Together, they try to hit it big and earn her a role on a series of television commercials. An episode of Spin City, "Wife With Mikey", is titled with a nod to this film. It is the last episode in which Fox appears, having left the regular cast at the beginning of the previous season due to his worsening Parkinson's.
