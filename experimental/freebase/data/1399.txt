Black Christmas is a 1974 Canadian horror film directed by Bob Clark and written by A. Roy Moore. It stars Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin, Marian Waldman and John Saxon. It follows a group of college students who must face a deranged serial killer lurking in their sorority house. The movie was inspired by an urban legend called "The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs", but was also largely based on a series of murders that took place in Quebec, Canada around Christmas time. It is generally considered to be one of the first slasher films. A remake of the same name, produced by Clark, was released on 25 December 2006. A sorority house is hosting a Christmas party late into the night. A seemingly disoriented man climbs up the house's trellis and through an open attic window. During the party, sorority sister Jess Bradford (Olivia Hussey) receives an obscene phone call from a recurrent caller the house has named "the moaner". After Barbara "Barb" Coard (Margot Kidder) jokingly provokes the caller, he replies, "I'm going to kill you", then hangs up. Soon after, Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) is offended by Barb and goes upstairs to finish packing for her trip
