Unforgettable is a 1996 thriller with science fiction elements, directed by John Dahl and starring Ray Liotta and Linda Fiorentino. The movie is about a man named David Krane (Liotta), who is obsessed with finding out who murdered his wife. The movie is John Dahl's follow up to his critically acclaimed film, The Last Seduction. Unforgettable, however was a box office failure, only earning less than $3 million in the U.S. In Unforgettable, Dr. David Krane (Ray Liotta) is unsuccessfully framed for the murder of his wife. He then attempts to find the true killer, with the help of Dr. Martha Briggs (Linda Fiorentino), by using an experimental drug that allows him to experience another person's memories. The drug takes a heavy toll and it's a race to find out the truth before time runs out. In the end it is revealed that Bresler, a policeman, was the one that killed Krane's wife, in order to frame Eddie Dutton, who was the prime suspect in the murder. Bresler goes to jail for a long time, while Krane ends up in a comatose state due to an overdose of the drug. Briggs and Gleick, Bresler's partner, realize the comatose Krane is in a 'better place' where he can be with his late wife.
