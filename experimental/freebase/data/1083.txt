Albino Alligator is a 1997 film directed by Kevin Spacey in his directorial debut. It stars Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise and William Fichtner as three small-time criminals who take hostages when they are cornered by the police. The title of the film refers to the way that alligators will use an albino among them as a sacrifice, so that the opposing alligators will be distracted and prey themselves. Brothers Dova (Matt Dillon) and Milo (Gary Sinise) are small-time crooks suddenly in way over their heads. When a holdup goes terribly wrong, the robbers flee to a local bar, desperately taking everyone inside hostage. With nowhere to run and time running out, it's a deadly situation where every second counts. Reviews for the film were generally mixed. It maintains a 47% "rotten" rating according to the Rotten Tomatoes website. Faye Dunaway was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Supporting Actress. Box Office Mojo Rotten Tomatoes
