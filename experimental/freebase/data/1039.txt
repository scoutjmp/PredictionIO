/m/0prh7
Hamlet is a 1996 film version of William Shakespeare's classic play of the same name, adapted for the screen and directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also stars in the titular role as Prince Hamlet. The film also features Derek Jacobi as King Claudius, Julie Christie as Queen Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Michael Maloney as Laertes, Richard Briers as Polonius, and Nicholas Farrell as Horatio. Other notable appearances include Robin Williams, GÃ©rard Depardieu, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, Rufus Sewell, Charlton Heston, Richard Attenborough, Judi Dench, and John Gielgud. The film is notable as the first unabridged theatrical film version of the play, running just over four hours. The longest version of the play prior to the 1996 film was the 1980 BBC made-for-television version starring Derek Jacobi, which runs three-and-a-half hours. Although the dialogue is unchanged in the 1996 Hamlet, the play's setting is updated to the 19th century. Blenheim Palace is the setting used for the exterior grounds of Elsinore Castle and interiors were all photographed at Shepperton Studios, blended with the footage shot at Blenheim. Hamlet is also the last major dramatic motion picture to be filmed
