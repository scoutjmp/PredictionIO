Shooter is a 2007 American conspiracy thriller film directed by Antoine Fuqua based on the novel Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter. The film concerns a former United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper, Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), who is framed for murder by a rogue secret private military company unit. It was released in cinemas on March 23, 2007. Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), a retired U.S. Marine Corps Force Recon Gunnery Sergeant and Scout Sniper, is one of the few snipers in the world whose marksmanship abilities allow him to "take out a target from a mile away". He reluctantly leaves a self-imposed exile from his isolated mountain home in the Wind River Range at the request of Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover). Johnson appeals to Swagger's expertise and patriotism to help track down an assassin who plans on shooting the president from a great distance with a high powered rifle. Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit so Swagger can determine if an attempt could be made at any of them. Swagger assesses each of the locations and determines that a site in Philadelphia would be most conducive to a long range assassination
