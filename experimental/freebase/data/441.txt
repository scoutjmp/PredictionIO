The Amityville Horror is a 1979 American horror film based on the bestselling 1977 novel of the same name by Jay Anson. It is the first movie in the Amityville Horror franchise. A remake was produced in 2005. The story is based on the alleged real life experiences of the Lutz family who buy a new home on 112 Ocean Avenue, Long Island, a house where a mass murder had been committed the year before. After the family move into the house, they experience a series of frightening paranormal events. In December 1975, George Lutz (James Brolin), his wife Kathy (Margot Kidder) and their three children move into a Dutch colonial house in Amityville, New York. Thirteen months earlier, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. had shot and killed six members of his family at the house. The Lutzes are aware of the house's history, and they ask Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) to bless it, but he is driven out by a swarm of flies during the blessing. After 28 days the Lutzes flee the house, having been terrorized by numerous paranormal phenomena while living there. The on-location scenes of The Amityville Horror were filmed at a house in Toms River, New Jersey, which had been converted to look like the 112 Ocean Avenue
