Diabolique (1996) is an American film directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Don Roos. The film stars Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. It is a remake of the French film Les Diaboliques (1955) directed by Clouzot. Filming took place in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The wife and mistress (Adjani and Stone) of a cruel school master (Palminteri) collaborate in a carefully planned and executed attempt to murder him. The plan goes well until the body, which has been strategically dumped, disappears. The strain starts to tell on the two women as a retired police investigator (Bates) who is looking into the disappearance on a whim begins to think that they know more than they are telling, and further complications arise when their victim is seen, apparently alive and well by several of the pupils. The move was compared unfavorably to the original movie. The movie was not a success.
