House Party 3 is a 1994 comedy film, starring Kid 'n Play and Bernie Mac and TLC. It is the third and intended final installment of the House Party film series, and the last film in the series to feature Kid 'n Play. This was to be the last film in the franchise, making it a trilogy but 7 years later, a direct to video sequel was released. This is also the first film in the series that Martin Lawrence does not reprise his role as Bilal, nor was he mentioned. Christopher, aka Kid (Christopher "Kid" Reid) is taking the plunge and marrying his girlfriend Veda (Angela Means), while his best friend Peter, aka Play (Christopher "Play" Martin) is dipping his fingers into the music business and attempting to manage a roughneck female rap act called Sex as a Weapon (TLC). Play books the ladies for a concert with heavy-hitting promoter Showboat (Michael Colyar), but when they decide to fire Play and hire a new manager, he has to figure out how to deliver them to the show or face the wrath of Showboat's female security force. Things eventually begin to spiral out of control for the two, as Play is also planning the bachelor party while trying to keep Kid's three younger cousins from Detroit
