/m/0d87hc
The Nutty Professor is a 1996 science fiction romantic comedy film starring Eddie Murphy. It is a remake of the 1963 film of the same name, starring Jerry Lewis. The original music score was composed by David Newman. The film won an Academy Award for Makeup. Murphy portrays as benevolent university professor Sherman Klump, who is morbidly obese. He invents a miracle weight-loss potion and, hoping to win the affection of the girl of his dreams, tries it on himself. Social situations demand that he call himself by a different name while he is using the potion and his slim self becomes an independent personality. Like the original film's Julius Kelp, Klump's trim and stylish (but arrogant) alter ego is also named Buddy Love. Murphy plays a total of seven characters in the film, including Sherman, most of Sherman's family (except for his nephew, Ernie "Hercules" Klump Jr. played by actor Jamal Mixon) and an over-the-top parody of Richard Simmons. A sequel, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, was released in 2000. A prequel has been announced for a possible 2012 release. The film was re-released on Blu-ray combo pack on March 6th, 2012, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Universal
