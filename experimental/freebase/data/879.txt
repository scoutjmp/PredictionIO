/m/034scm
The Peacemaker is a 1997 American action/thriller film starring George Clooney and Nicole Kidman and directed by Mimi Leder. It is also notable as being the first film released by DreamWorks. While the story takes place all over the world, it was shot primarily in Macedonia, with some sequences in New York and Philadelphia, and, to a greater extent, in Bratislava and Vienna. The story begins in an Eastern Orthodox church in Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina when an unidentified man (later revealed to be a Bosnian diplomat to the UN) is murdered in the church's narthex after receiving a page to meet someone outside. The scene then shifts to a missile base in Chelyabinsk, Russia, where SS-18 ICBMs are being decommissioned. Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksandr Kodorov, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers on-board the transport train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train running on parallel tracks. Kodorov then activates the timer on the remaining warhead and shunts the transport away from his train and onto a collision course
