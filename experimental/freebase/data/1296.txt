Indian Summer is a 1993 comedy drama film written and directed by Mike Binder. The movie was filmed and set on-location at Camp Tamakwa, a summer camp located in Ontario, Canada, where Binder himself had attended in his childhood. The film features an ensemble cast, including film director Sam Raimi, a childhood friend of Binder's, who plays a supporting role as handyman Stick Coder. "Unca" Lou Handler (Alan Arkin), the beloved camp director and owner of Camp Tamakwa, invites eight former campers, all now adults, back to the camp to announce his retirement. Lou claims to have chosen these friends as they were the group from the camp's "golden years" 20 years previously. Once there, the group comes to feel nostalgic memories of their youth and the unresolved feelings for each other begin to surface.
