Wings of Courage is a 1995 American-French drama film directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. The 40-minute picture was written by Annaud with Alain Godard. It was the world's first dramatic picture shot in the IMAX-format. Additionally, it was the first 3-D IMAX fiction film. The film is an account of the real-life story of early airmail pilot Henri Guillaumet (Craig Sheffer), whose small plane crashes in the South American Andes, forcing him to trek back to civilization on foot. Meanwhile the story follows his family and friends at home, and their growing concern for him. Elizabeth McGovern, Val Kilmer and Tom Hulce also star.
