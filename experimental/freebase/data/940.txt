Airheads is a 1994 American comedy film written by Rich Wilkes and directed by Michael Lehmann. It stars Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi and Adam Sandler as a band of loser musicians called "The Lone Rangers" who take a radio station hostage, just so that their song would get played on the radio. Joe Mantegna plays the radio station's DJ and Michael McKean plays the Station Manager. Based on an original screenplay by Ryan T Young of Lampoon fame, Chazz, Rex and Pip are a Los Angeles would-be rock band called The Lone Rangers. The guys are continuously turned down as they try to get their demo tape heard by producers. They finally decide to try to get the local rock station, KPPX 103.6 ("Rebel Radio"), to play it on the air, after they saw how Rebel Radio helped another band The Sons of Thunder get a record deal. Their first break-in attempt is using Pip's ATM card and its PIN. The card's confiscated. Then, Rex tries to short circuit the electronic lock with Pip's Big Gulp. They finally get in when a station employee Suzzi comes out and they keep the door from shutting behind her. Once inside, DJ Ian "The Shark" puts them on the air without them knowing.
