/m/0328vs
Canadian Bacon is a 1995 comedy film which satirizes Canada–United States relations along the Canada–United States border written, directed and produced by Michael Moore. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, and has the distinction of being the final completed film to star John Candy (it was filmed before Wagons East! hence Candy sports the same long beard in this film as in Wagons East!). The President of the United States (Alan Alda) has not led his country into war, and his approval rating falls. His National Security Advisor Stuart Smiley (Kevin Pollak) suggests Canada as a new enemy, based on a news segment about a barroom brawl between Canadians and Americans at a bar in Niagara Falls, New York over national beer preference. A local American sheriff, Bud Boomer (John Candy), who was responsible for the brawl, is caught up in the idea of invading Canada and leads a smal group of fellow Americans into the country to commit the "most serious of all" Canadian crimes, littering! The so-called invasion is foiled, but, because of Boomer's actions, the fabricated war turns into a real one. The film was shot in late 1993, in Toronto,
