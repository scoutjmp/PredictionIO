Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering is the fourth film in the Children of the Corn horror series. It was released in 1996, and directed by Greg Spence. The film stars Naomi Watts and Karen Black. The first in the series to go straight to video, Children of the Corn IV is considered to be a standalone film, as the plot is unrelated to the previous films. Several children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher named Josiah who seeks revenge on the town that killed him. The kids assume the identities of dead children from that town's history, and attempt to resurrect Josiah from the dead.
