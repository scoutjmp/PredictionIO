Gang Related (1997) is a neo-noir crime film written and directed by Jim Kouf which stars James Belushi, Dennis Quaid, James Earl Jones, David Paymer and rapper Tupac Shakur. The film revolves around two corrupt detectives who attempt to frame a homeless man for the murder of undercover DEA agent they themselves had killed. The film is also famous for being Tupac Shakur's last movie performance. Renegade police detectives Frank Divinci (James Belushi) and Jake Rodriguez (Tupac Shakur) gun down narcotics dealer Lionel Hudd (Kool Moe Dee), after the three engage illegally in drug trafficking; this is in order to recover the cocaine Hudd purchased from them.

It doesn't help that Rodriguez has outstanding gambling debts, and that a huge man known only as "Mr. Cutlass Supreme" (Tiny Lister) is on his case for it. After arresting numerous felons without success (because they cannot possibly link Hudd's murder to any of them), Divinci and Rodriguez arrest a homeless drunk
