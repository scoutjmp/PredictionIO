The film starts in 1924 with Richard and his father Melville walking through the woods where Melville shows his scientific inspiration for Richard. In 1934, Richard & Arline are in high school and their romantic relationship starts. The story then jumps to his college years and Arline getting sick with lymphatic tuberculosis.

The film ends with Feynman crying at the sight of the red dress Arline had pointed out. Michelle Feynman, the daughter adopted by Richard and Gweneth Feynman in 1968,
