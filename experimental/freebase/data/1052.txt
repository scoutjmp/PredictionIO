Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995)
/m/02_lmb
Dracula: Dead and Loving It is a 1995 comedy film starring Leslie Nielsen, directed by Mel Brooks. It is a parody of the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker, and of some of the films it inspired. Brooks co-authored the screenplay with Steve Haberman and Rudy DeLuca. He also appears as Dr. Van Helsing. The film's other stars include Steven Weber, Amy Yasbeck, Peter MacNicol, Harvey Korman, and Anne Bancroft. The film follows the classic Dracula (1931), starring Bela Lugosi, in its deviations from the novel. Its visual style and production values are particularly evocative of the Hammer Horror films. It spoofed, among other movies, The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967) and Dracula (1992). As of 2012, it is the last film to be directed by Brooks. The year is 1893: solicitor Thomas Renfield (Peter MacNicol) travels all the way from London to "Castle Dracula" in Transylvania to finalise Count Dracula's purchase of Carfax Abbey in England. As the sun sets, and the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further, Renfield continues on foot despite the villagers (including Chuck McCann and Anne Bancroft in cameos) pleading with him to turn back. Renfield arrives safely and meets Count Dracula
