Safe Passage is a 1994 English language drama film starring Susan Sarandon, and featuring Nick Stahl, Sam Shepard, Sean Astin and Jason London. Directed by Robert Allan Ackerman from a screenplay by Deena Goldstone, it is based on the novel Safe Passage by Ellyn Bache. Maggie Singer (Susan Sarandon) is an obsessive, superstitious and moderately psychic woman who has premonitions in her dreams. The mother of seven children, only one of which still lives at home, she is getting divorced from her husband, and plans to move into the city and take a job as a civil servant. When she learns that there has been a terrorist explosion on the military base where one of her sons, Percival, is stationed with the Marines, her family gathers at the house and attempts to find out what has happened. Safe Passage was shot in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. It began shooting on January 26, 1994, and completed on March 22 of that year. The film was held up for release by a court injunction brought by Dan Lupowitz, who brought both the director and Susan Sarandon into the project, and who wanted an "executive producer" credit.
