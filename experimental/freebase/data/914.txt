Wild Things is a 1998 erotic thriller film starring Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Kevin Bacon, Denise Richards, Theresa Russell and Bill Murray. It was directed by John McNaughton. In some countries the film was released as Sex Crimes. An uncut version of the movie, adding seven minutes to its runtime, was released on DVD in 2004 and includes a change to Kelly and Suzie's relationship. The movie gained notoriety for featuring several sex scenes - in particular, one involving a man and two women simultaneously - that were more explicit than is typically seen in mainstream, big-budget Hollywood movies. It spawned several direct-to-DVD sequels. The film has a MPAA rating of R for strong sexuality, nudity, language and violence. Times guidelines refer to a strong menage a trois scene (involving Dillon, Campbell and Richards, who is in the nude) and some passionate girl-girl kissing (Campbell and Richards, both of whom are topless). There is also incidental male frontal nudity (Bacon). High school guidance counselor Sam Lombardo (Dillon) is accused of rape by two students, Kelly Van Ryan (Richards) and Suzie Toller (Campbell). Lombardo hires lawyer Kenneth Bowden (Murray) to defend
