Anastasia is a 1997 American animated musical adventure drama film produced and directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. It was the first musical feature film to be released by Fox Animation Studios. The film features the voices of Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyd, Hank Azaria, Bernadette Peters, and Angela Lansbury. The idea for the film originated from 20th Century Fox's 1956 live-action film of the same name. The plot is loosely based on an urban legend which claimed that Anastasia, the youngest daughter of Nicholas II–the last Emperor of Russia–in fact survived the execution of her family, and thus takes various liberties with historical fact. Anastasia first premiered nationwide in the United States on November 21, 1997 and, despite the objections of some historians to its fantastical retelling of the life of the Grand Duchess, enjoyed a positive reception from many critics. Although the budget of the film comprised only $53,000,000, it earned $139,804,348 on a global scale, making Anastasia a box office success. The film also received nominations for several awards, including two Oscars for Best Original Song ("Journey to the Past") and Best Original
