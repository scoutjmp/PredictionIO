The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Ann (Andie MacDowell) lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John (Peter Gallagher) and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton (James Spader) is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval
