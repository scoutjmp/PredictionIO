It Takes Two is a 1995 film starring Kirstie Alley, Steve Guttenberg and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. The movie title was taken from the song "It Takes Two", song by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston, which was featured in the closing credits. It Takes Two boasts some similarities to Walt Disney's The Parent Trap and Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, which was pointed out in Leonard Maltin's review of the film. Two unrelated young girls who happen to look identical suddenly meet. Amanda Lemmon (Mary-Kate Olsen) is an orphan, and she is about to be adopted by the Butkises, a family whom she doesn't like. She actually wants her child-loving case worker Diane Barrows (Kirstie Alley) to adopt her instead. She would like to do so, but authorities will not let her because of her low salary. Alyssa Callaway (Ashley Olsen) is coming home from her boarding school's piano recital competition, only to find that her wealthy father Roger (Steve Guttenberg) is about to marry Clarice Kensington (Jane Sibbett) a socialite who (secretly) hates kids and baseball, which Roger adores. The girls switch places and find out that Roger and Diane would fit together perfectly. So they arrange "chance"
