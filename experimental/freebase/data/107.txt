The film is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Defoe. A young girl is picked up from a London orphanage and is told the story of her mother's (Moll Flanders) life on the way to the British West Indies. Based on reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, Moll Flanders currently has a 47% approval rating from critics.

The International Press Academy nominated Moll Flanders for four awards: Robin
