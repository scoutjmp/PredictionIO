Boys in Venice (1996)
/m/04yjb06
"The Boys of Venice is one incredibly dated yet incredibly hot entry from director William Higgins. There's lots of bad - and tight - clothes, heinous disco music, and terrific facial cum-glazings all over the place here. There's also lots of "straight dudes" (replete with girlfriends) getting it on with another dude for the first time.  One of the film's highlights features Eric Ryan and Derrick Stanton romping in a public bathroom which Derrick christens by taking a wild on-camera pee - while perched on rollerskates the whole time. It's as hot as it sounds. (It's all very Can't Stop the Music-esque.)  Other scenes include Scott Taylor taking photos of himself while jacking off (really good scene), Clay Russell and Butch rutting about in their beach-front apartment, Johnny Stone and Jimmy Young in a whore-baggin' trick scenario in a truck by the ocean, and the yummy Emmanuelle Bravos and Kip Noll in a disco (with bitches in tow!) fantasizing about having sex with each other right on the dancefloor.  This fantastic trip back in the day is Higgins' first film, and if you really dig late-70s era sleaze this one is sure to get to you." Quoting a review by Keeneye Reeves
