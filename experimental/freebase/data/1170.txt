The title of the movie is a slang phrase for masturbation and is used in the film by one of the teenage characters. It was filmed in Pawling, New York. Spanking the Monkey won the Audience Award at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival and the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. It was produced by Dean Silvers of Teatown Communications Group. Susan Aibelli (Alberta Watson), a married, lonely woman, suffers a leg injury at home just as her husband is about to leave on his job as a travelling salesman and her son, Raymond (Jeremy Davies), is about to leave for the summer on a medical internship. Her son is forced to stay at home to take care of her as his father is gone. He loses both the internship and his girlfriend. These troublesome events leave him emotionally confused as he and his mother are left alone together, and they develop an incestuous relationship. Select tracks from Morphine's album Cure for Pain are used throughout the film, including "In Spite of Me" which plays over the end credits.
