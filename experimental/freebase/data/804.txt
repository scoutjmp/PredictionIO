Jimmy Hollywood is an American comedy film written and directed by Barry Levinson and starring Joe Pesci and Christian Slater. While initially unsuccessful at the box office, it has since gained a cult following. Jimmy Alto (Pesci) is a failing actor living in Los Angeles. After increasing frustration with crime in the city Jimmy, along with his 'spaced-out' best friend William (Slater), decides to take the law into his own hands. Jimmy transforms himself into 'Jericho', leader of a mock-vigilante group that videotapes criminals and then turns them over to the police. Eventually the police begin to close in on the group and the film ends with a tense stand off in the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre. Robbie Robertson created music for the film and produced the soundtrack.
