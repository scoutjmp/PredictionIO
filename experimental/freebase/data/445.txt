/m/0921ps
The Body Snatcher is a 1945 horror film directed by Robert Wise based on the short story The Body Snatcher by Robert Louis Stevenson. The film's producer Val Lewton helped adapt the story for the screen, writing under the pen name of "Carlos Keith". The film was marketed with the tagline The screen's last word in shock sensation!. The frequent mentions of Burke, Hare, and Dr. Knox, all refer to the West Port murders in 1828. This would be the last film to feature both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. In Edinburgh in 1831, one year before the Anatomy Act was passed, a surgeon (Henry Daniell) hires a cabman (Boris Karloff) to dig up graves to provide him with fresh corpses for dissection â€“ but the body provider turns to murder to get new corpses for the doctor. The film was released for the first time on DVD in 2005, along with I Walked with a Zombie, as part of the Val Lewton Horror Collection.
