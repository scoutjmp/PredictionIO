Hurricane Streets (aka Hurricane) is a 1997 American coming-of-age drama which was the debut feature film from writer-director Morgan J. Freeman (not to be confused with actor Morgan Freeman). The film won the Audience, Best Director, and Best Cinematography Awards at the 1997 Sundance Film Festivalâ€”the first film ever to win three awards at the festival. It was released by MGM and stars Brendan Sexton III and Edie Falco. Fourteen-year old Marcus (Sexton) is growing up in a rough part of New York City. His father is dead, and his mother languishes in prison for murder. He lives with his grandmother, whose work as a bartender gives Marcus a lot of unsupervised time to hang out with other teens. The teens spend their time doing mischief and petty crimes such as stealing CDs and running shoes. Before long, the teens plan more serious crimes. Marcus' friend Melena (Isidra Vega), who also grew up in a rough, abusive home, tries to steer Marcus away from the path to crime.
