Sexual Life of the Belgians, The (1994)
/m/0czd4r1
La Vie sexuelle des Belges 1950-78 is a 1994 film satire on Belgian provincialism that proved a major cinematic success in Belgium. It was the first film by now-famed Flemish provocateur and director Jan Bucquoy. It tells an autobiographical tale of a clueless young bumpkin, Jan, trying far from successfully to keep up with times failing equally at being a 60s free-love youth or political activist and finally sinking into a mundane bourgeoise life.
