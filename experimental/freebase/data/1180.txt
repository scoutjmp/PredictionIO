I Love Trouble is a 1994 American romantic comedy film starring Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte. It was written and produced by the husband-and-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, and directed by Shyer. Rival Chicago reporters Sabrina Peterson (Roberts) and Peter Brackett (Nolte) reluctantly join forces to uncover a train wreck conspiracy. They bite off more than they can chew while pursuing the story and bickering along the way, falling in love. Sabrina is an ambitious, gifted reporter willing to do whatever it takes to learn the truth about the train accident. This leads her into conflict, then reluctant partnership, with fading star Peter, who works for a rival paper. He chases women, smokes cigars, and has just published his first novel. During their pursuit of the story, Peter and Sabrina clash over virtually everything. He also subjects Sabrina to indecent exposure in front of a group of boy scouts after he catches her skinny-dipping. But ultimately they collaborate in solving the crime, sharing the story and beginning a romance. The film was not well-received by critics, although it grossed over $30 million in box-office receipts in the United States.  According to
