/m/08rwj2
The Pest is a 1997 American comedy film inspired by the classic short story "The Most Dangerous Game". Comedian John Leguizamo plays a Puerto Rican con artist in Miami, Florida named Pestario Rivera Garcia Picante Salsa Vargas (also known as "Pest") who agrees to be the human target for a racist German manhunter for a $50,000 reward. The film was considered to be a critical dud though it has since gained cult status due to a bizarre premise: A Nazi who has killed and collected every ethnicity needs a Latino to complete his collection. Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 9%. While Jeff Miller of the Houston Chronicle ops "This film is utterly without discipline or focus in a way that—to one's shame—one eventually finds oddly endearing," Dwayne E. Leslie of Boxoffice Magazine said that "The script and Leguizamo's talents don't mesh, so the actor comes off as more offensive than funny." But Bill Hoffman of The New York Post gave the comedy four and half out of five stars. The film grossed $4 million. On the Internet Movie Database, the film has an overall rating of 4.3/10 with 4,308 votes. Director Paul Miller
