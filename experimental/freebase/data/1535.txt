/m/04n6vgs
L'Enfer ("Hell") is a 1994 French film directed by Claude Chabrol. It was adapted by Chabrol from the screenplay by Henri-Georges Clouzot for the unfinished film L'Enfer, which Clouzot began shooting in 1964 but was unable to complete. The producer of Chabrol's film was Marin Karmitz and the leading actors were Emmanuelle Béart and François Cluzet. Paul (Cluzet) and Nelly (Béart) are a married couple who run a successful hotel. Paul begins to suspect Nelly of being unfaithful, and eventually descends into paranoia from which there is no escape. Instead of the usual final caption, "The End", L'Enfer finishes on a caption that reads "Without end..."
