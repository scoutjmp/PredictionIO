You So Crazy (1994) is a stand up comedy film starring Martin Lawrence. It was his first major film and stand up act. The film was directed by Thomas Schlamme, who is most notable for filming scores of television series such as Ally McBeal and Spin City. The film features a young Lawrence in a black, leather suit similar to the wardrobe worn by Eddie Murphy in his films Delirious and Raw. During the routine, Lawrence touches on everything from his success, growing up, sexual acts and racism. The concert was filmed at the Majestic Theatre in New York City before a sold out crowd. Martin followed You So Crazy up with Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat in 2002. You So Crazy helped Lawrence breakout during the early 1990s. He had also starred in television series including his own, Martin, and had bit parts and co-starring roles in some films such as the House Party series. The film went on to become a success for Lawrence, generating over $10 million at the box office. The film originally received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, causing Miramax (the film's original distributor) to sell it to Samuel Goldwyn, which released it unrated.
