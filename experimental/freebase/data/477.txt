Matilda is a 1996 American fantasy film directed by Danny DeVito, based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film was released by TriStar Pictures on August 2, 1996 and stars Mara Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, and Pam Ferris. Matilda Wormwood is an extremely intelligent girl with a bright personality. However, her parents, Harry and Zinnia, are irresponsible parents who would rather focus on their work and their leisure time than Matilda. Harry "sells used cars, for unfair prices", while vacuous, self-centered Zinnia goes out to play bingo, and Matilda's older brother Michael goes to school, leaving Matilda alone in the house. At the age of 4, after her father refuses to buy her a book, Matilda starts visiting the library. She absorbs knowledge like a sponge, but her bookishness damages her relationship with her father. After being tormented by her father, she sets two revenges on him: she bleaches his hair from black to blonde by replacing his hair oil with peroxide, and she glues her father’s hat on, on the day when her father demonstrates his motoring abilities to Michael, who is just as bad as Matilda’s parents. The pranks make Matilda’s father
