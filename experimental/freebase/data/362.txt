Blues Brothers 2000 is a 1998 American musical comedy film that is a sequel to the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. Directed by John Landis, the film featured Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman, with cameos by many musicians. Blues Brothers 2000 picks up 18 years after The Blues Brothers with Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) being released from prison, this time a rather high-tech private prison rather than the old Illinois state prison depicted in the first film. He learns that his brother Jake has died, along with their surrogate father figure Curtis (Cab Calloway), and that the orphanage the two had saved is no more. However, Elwood is told of a second brother (of sorts). The "brother" is the illegitimate son of Curtis named Cabel "Cab" Chamberlain (Joe Morton) who, until Elwood enters his life, had no knowledge of being Curtis's son. Cab is a commander in the Illinois State Police. He angrily refuses to support Elwood, a habitual criminal, but Elwood steals his wallet and buys a used police squad car at a lot owned by Malvern Gasperone (B.B. King), who is leaving the business to move to New Orleans. Elwood takes a job as a master of ceremonies in a strip club owned by the drummer of the Blues
