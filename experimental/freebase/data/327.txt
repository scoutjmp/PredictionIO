It features an ensemble cast featuring Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Michael Rapaport, Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Arthur Nascarella and John Spencer. Set in 1988 in a fictional town of Garrison, New Jersey, located across the Hudson River from New York City, a large number of residents are NYPD Officers. One night, the car of young cop Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Rapaport), nephew of Lt. Ray Donlan (Keitel), is sideswiped on the George Washington Bridge by a couple of African-American teens. Thinking they had fired at him, Babitch fires back and the teens are killed in the ensuing crash. Worried about a possible racial incident, Ray's solution is to fake a suicide, pretending that Babitch jumped off the GWB. When a corrupt cop, Jack Rucker (Patrick), is caught trying to plant a weapon to justify the shooting, other corrupt Officers, including Det. Leo Crasky (Spencer) and Frank Lagonda (Nascarella), fear Babitch will resurface and testify to Internal Affairs. IA Investigator Lt. Moe Tilden (De Niro) asks Garrison's mild-mannered half deaf Sheriff Freddy Heflin
