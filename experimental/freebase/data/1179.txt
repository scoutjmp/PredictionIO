Roland Sharp (portrayed by Jones), a lonesome Texas Ranger who goes undercover as an assistant cheerleading coach to protect a group of college cheerleaders (Christina Milian, Vanessa Ferlito, Paula Garc√©s, Monica Keena, and Kelli Garner) who have witnessed a murder. Much of the film was shot in Austin, Texas on the University of Texas campus. Texas Governor Rick Perry has a cameo appearance in the film as himself. At the beginning of the film, two Texas Rangers, Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) and Maggie Swanson (Liz Vassey), are going to a church in order to question Percy Stevens (Cedric the Entertainer) about the whereabouts of his former prison roommate Morgan Ball, who they want to testify against organized crime boss John Cortland. Percy is indignant, telling them he is a "man of God" and hasn't spoken with Ball in years. However, Percy's cellphone rings, displaying Ball's name. Sharp and Swanson track down Ball to the warehouse, where Ball gives Sharp a key in an attempt to buy him off.
