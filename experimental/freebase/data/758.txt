Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace is a 1996 film, and the sequel to The Lawnmower Man, which was loosely based on a short story by Stephen King. Retitled Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War for the video release, the film stars Matt Frewer as Jobe. The founder of virtual reality, Dr. Benjamin Trace (Patrick Bergin), has lost a legal battle to secure a patent on the most powerful worldwide communications chip ever invented. Touted as the one operating system to control all others, in the wrong hands the "Chiron Chip" has the potential to dominate a society dependent on computers. When corporate tycoon and virtual reality entrepreneur Jonathan Walker (Kevin Conway) takes over development of the Chiron Chip, he and his team discover Jobe Smith (Matt Frewer) barely alive after the explosion at the end of the first film. Reconstructing his face and hooking him up to their database, they plan to use Jobe to help them perfect the Chiron Chip. Six years later, a now 16-year-old Peter Parkette (Austin O'Brien) is a computer hacker and lives in the subways of Los Angeles with his girlfriend and two other friends. While hooked into cyberspace, Jobe reconnects with Peter and asks him to find Dr.
