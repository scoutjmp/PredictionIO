/m/06wp_k
Princess Caraboo is a 1994 British-American historical comedy-drama film co-written (with John Wells) and directed by Michael Austin, based on the real-life 19th-century character Princess Caraboo, who passed herself off in British society as an exotic princess who spoke a strange foreign language; she is portrayed by Phoebe Cates. In 1817, a young woman (Phoebe Cates) appears in the English countryside, wearing exotic garb and speaking gibberish. She also bears unusual tattoos on her legs. Delivered to a nearby manor, the mystery woman is sheltered by the Worralls (Jim Broadbent and Wendy Hughes), who are then persuaded by their suspicious butler Frixos (Kevin Kline) to have the drifter tried for vagrancy and begging, capital crimes. At the hearing, however, the woman persuades the magistrates through pantomime that she is a princess of Polynesian origin named Caraboo, escaped from pirate kidnappers. The Worralls welcome Caraboo back into their home, lavishing upon her the deference due a royal member. A society sensation, Caraboo wins over a linguist (John Lithgow), the prince regent (John Sessions), and even Frixos. Only an Irish reporter, Gutch (Stephen Rea), remains skeptical
