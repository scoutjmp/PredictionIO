Fathers' Day is a 1997 comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Nastassja Kinski. It is a remake of the 1983 French film Les Comp√®res. In the film, Collette Andrews (Kinski) gets two former lovers, cynical lawyer Jack Lawrence (Crystal) and lonely, ex-hippie, suicidal writer Dale Putley (Williams) to help her search for her runaway teenage son Scott by telling each man that he is the father. When Jack and Dale run into each other and find out what's happening, they work together to find Scott and determine the identity of the actual father, who turns out to be Collette's husband, Bob. The film features an appearance by the musical group Sugar Ray, and Mel Gibson makes a brief uncredited cameo appearance. IMDb credits Gibson as "Scott the Body Piercer". Catherine Reitman and Jason Reitman also have cameos. In South Africa, Fathers' Day was released as What's Up Pop's?, a title the distributor decided would be more appropriate for the local market. The name was subsequently changed to What's Up Pops? for DVD release, when they realized the apostrophe had been used incorrectly. The movie was not a success with either
