The Killer (simplified Chinese: 喋血双雄; traditional Chinese: 喋血雙雄; pinyin: Diéxuè shuāngxióng Jyutping: dip6 hyut3 soeng1 hung4) is a 1989 Hong Kong action and crime film written and directed by John Woo and starring Chow Yun-Fat, Danny Lee and Sally Yeh. Chow plays the assassin Ah Jong, who accidentally damages the eyes of the singer Jennie (Sally Yeh) during a shootout. He later discovers that if Jennie does not have an expensive operation she will go blind. To get the money for Jennie, Ah Jong decides to perform one last hit. After the financial backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following the release of Woo's film A Better Tomorrow 2, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose plot was influenced by the films Le Samouraï, Mean Streets, and Narazumono. Woo desired to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to The Killer as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese. The Killer was not an immediate success in Hong Kong, but received critical acclaim in the Western world
