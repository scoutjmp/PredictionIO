/m/0b8l01
The Swan Princess is a 1994 American animated film based on the ballet "Swan Lake". Starring the voice talents of Jack Palance, John Cleese, Steven Wright, and Sandy Duncan, the film is directed by a former Disney animation director, Richard Rich, with a music score by Lex de Azevedo. The film was followed by two direct-to-video sequels: The Swan Princess II: Escape from Castle Mountain (1997) and The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom (1998). The film begins with an aging king named William (Dakin Matthews) who has a daughter named Odette (Michelle Nicastro/Liz Callaway). His friend, the widowed Queen Uberta (Sandy Duncan) decide to have Odette and the Queen's son, Prince Derek (Adam Wylie/Howard McGillin), meet every summer with hopes they'd fall in love, so as to unite their kingdoms as one. At first, while Odette and Derek are still children, this fails to work, miserably, as hanging out together was not their "idea of fun". Years pass, and Odette and Derek reach young adulthood. During this time, the two finally begin to fall in love. However, during a royal ball, Derek expresses his wish to marry her for just her looks, which upsets Odette into rejecting him
