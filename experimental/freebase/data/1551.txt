The Glass Shield is a 1995 crime drama film starring Ice Cube, Michael Boatman and Lori Petty, directed by Charles Burnett. Deputy John Johnson (J.J.) (Michael Boatman) is a rookie in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the first black deputy (could read, 'only black deputy assigned') at the station to which he is assigned. Racial tensions run high in the department as some of J.J.'s fellow officers resent his presence. His only real friend is the other new deputy (Lori Petty), the first female officer to work there (could read, 'only female deputy assigned'), who also suffers similar discrimination in the otherwise all-white-male work environment. When J.J. becomes increasingly aware of police corruption during the murder trial of Teddy Woods (Ice Cube), who he helped to arrest, he faces difficult decisions and puts himself into grave personal danger in the service of justice.
