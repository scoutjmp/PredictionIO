The film stars Cher (as the wife), Ryan O'Neal (as the husband) and Chazz Palminteri (as the hit man) among others. It was entered into the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. On her twentieth wedding anniversary, Maggie receives a diamond necklace and a price on her head; both from her husband, Jack. While waiting for the signal, all the way from Connecticut, to do the murder, the hitman starts bonding with Maggie instead. Later, Jack shows up himself, complicating the entire situation. The film was received poorly at the box office, grossing just $2,104,439. It was a huge drop compared to Cher's previous starring role, Mermaids, which grossed $35,419,397 in 1990. The film's opening weekend of just $967,956 would end as 46% of the film's total gross. This film was also Cher's least successful film of the decade in a starring role. The film was also widely panned by film critics earning a 7% "rotten" rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes.
