White Squall is a 1996 American drama feature film, directed by Ridley Scott. The film is based on the fate of the brigantine Albatross, which sank on 2 May 1961, allegedly because of a white squall. The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), whom the boys call "Skipper". He is tough and teaches them discipline. He forms a close connection with all-American Chuck Geague (Scott Wolf), troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont (Jeremy Sisto), shy Gil Martin (Ryan Phillippe) and bad-boy Dean Preston (Eric Michael Cole). When a white squall threatens their ship, the boys must use what Skipper has taught them to survive the horrific ordeal. Part of the film was shot using a horizon tank in Malta, with a full-sized ship, the Eye of the Wind, used to depict the Albatross. Maurice Jarre was originally slated to compose the original score, but was replaced by Hans Zimmer's protégé Jeff Rona. Zimmer was set to replace Jarre, but due to time difficulties failed to commit. The film holds a 65% based on 31 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes., the film, like Scott's previous film, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, was a box office disappointment. Roger Ebert
