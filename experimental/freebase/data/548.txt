The NeverEnding Story III: Escape from Fantasia (also known as: The NeverEnding Story III: Return to Fantasia) is a 1994 film and the second sequel to the fantasy film The NeverEnding Story (following the first sequel The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter). It starred Jason James Richter as the principal character Bastian Bux, and Jack Black in one of his early roles as the protagonist's tormentor, the school bully Slip. The special creature effects were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The Mountain of Destiny looms before us as we overhear the Old Man of Wandering Mountain (Freddie Jones) reading from a large book. Using a writing stylus he begins to record a prophecy of a day when 'The Nasty' will arrive in Fantasia. He goes on to describe the savior of "Extraordinary Courage". Bastian Balthazar Bux (Jason James Richter) has begun a new chapter in his life. His father Barney (Kevin McNulty) has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother named Jane (Tracey Ellis) whose daughter Nicole (Melody Kay) is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip (Jack Black).
