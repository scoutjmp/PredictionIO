T-Men is a semidocumentary style 1947 film noir shot in black-and-white. The film was directed by Anthony Mann with cinematography by noted noir cameraman John Alton. The B-movie is featured in Visions Of Light: The Art Of Cinematography (1992) documentary for the drama's use of lighting. A year later, director Mann used the film's male lead, Dennis O'Keefe, in Raw Deal. The story is about two U.S. Treasury agents who go undercover in an attempt to break a counterfeiting ring. The agents try to join the gang by posing as counterfeiters from out of town. They eventually join the gang but the stakes are set even higher when one of the agents is killed by the gang while the other undercover T-man watches in horror. The film was remade in 1969, as The File of the Golden Goose, directed by Sam Wanamaker and starring Yul Brynner and Edward Woodward and this time set in London, England instead of the United States. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound (Jack Whitney).
