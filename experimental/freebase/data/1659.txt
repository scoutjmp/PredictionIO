Getting Away with Murder is a 1996 comedy film written and directed by Harvey Miller. The film stars Dan Aykroyd, Jack Lemmon, Lily Tomlin and Bonnie Hunt. This was the final project for veteran writer and director Harvey Miller. It received poor reviews and was panned by critics. Jack Lambert's (Dan Aykroyd) neighbor Max Mueller (Jack Lemnon) is revealed on the TV news to be the escaped Nazi war criminal Karl Luger who was sentenced to death by the courts. Under the constant duress of the news media's allegations, Mueller plans to flee to South America. Angered that Mueller might never pay for his crimes, Lambert takes the drastic step of poisoning him by injecting cyanide into some of the fruit in Mueller's apple tree, from which he regularly makes freshly juiced apple juice. At first the police believe it's a suicide, which upsets Lambert so much that he mails them a cryptic letter to reveal that it was actually a murder to carry out the court sentence and to revenge all the lives taken. Later, the TV news reveals that Mueller was mis-identified and is innocent. Feeling guilty, Lambert does penance by dumping his fiancee Gail (Bonnie Hunt) and marrying Mueller's daughter Inga
