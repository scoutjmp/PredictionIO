Mi Vida Loca (also known as My Crazy Life) is a 1993 American drama film directed and written by Allison Anders. This film includes the first film appearances from Salma Hayek and Jason Lee. Lee appears in a small role alongside director Spike Jonze as a drug buyer. Mi Vida Loca tells the story of young Mexican-American women in Los Angeles and the struggles they have in a life of early motherhood while being members of a street gang. Mousie (Seidy López) and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles) are best friends from childhood, growing up in Echo Park, a neighborhood that had a significant amount of gang activity in the 1980s and 1990s, and remaining loyal to each other. But when Sad Girl sleeps with Mousie's boyfriend (a member of their neighborhood gang who is killed in a drug deal gone-bad) and becomes pregnant, their friendship is ruptured. As dramatic situations unfold around them, some that would turn violent, they must try to stay together as friends despite their betrayals. The film takes a rather independent look at a world where women seem to have no choice but to raise their children, involve themselves with gang activity, and survive by whatever means available.
