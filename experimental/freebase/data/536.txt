Ponette is a 1996 French film directed by Jacques Doillon. The film centers on four-year-old Ponette (Victoire Thivisol), who is coming to terms with the death of her mother. The film received acclaim for Thivisol's performance, who was only four at the time of filming. Ponette's mother dies in a car crash, which Ponette herself survives with only a broken arm (she consequently must wear an arm cast). After her mother's death, her father (Xavier Beauvois) leaves Ponette with her Aunt Claire (Claire Nebout), and her cousins Matiaz (Matiaz Bureau Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz). Ponette and her Cousins are then sent to boarding school where her loneliness and loss of mother becomes even more harsh and painful.  She is left with no choice but to try and find solace and sense of her loss with other little children who are themselves coping with their loss of parents because of separation due to boarding school. Ponette becomes increasingly withdrawn, and spends most of her time waiting for her mother to come back. When waiting alone fails, Ponette enlists the help of her school friend Ada (LÃ©opoldine Serre) to help her become a "child of God" to hopefully convince God to return
