Trainspotting is a 1996 British comedy drama film directed by Danny Boyle based on the novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh (who played hapless drug dealer Mikey Forrester).

The film stars Ewan McGregor as Renton, Ewen Bremner as Spud, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, Kevin McKidd as Tommy, Robert Carlyle as Begbie, and Kelly Macdonald as Diane.
