Ransom is a 1996 American crime thriller starring Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise, Delroy Lindo, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg, Lili Taylor, Evan Handler and Brawley Nolte and directed by Ron Howard. Gibson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Ransom was the 5th highest grossing film of 1996 in the United States. The original idea for the story was from an episode of The United States Steel Hour named "Fearful Decision" that aired in 1954. It was then adapted into a feature-length film of the same name in 1956, written by Richard Maibaum and Cyril Hume starring Glenn Ford, Donna Reed and Leslie Nielsen. The film also was influenced by King's Ransom, a police procedural novel by Ed McBain which was, in turn, the basis for Akira Kurosawa's 1963 film High and Low. The film earned mixed-to-positive reviews, and was a major financial success. While multi-millionaire airline owner Tom Mullen attends a science fair that his wife Kate is judging, their son Sean is kidnapped. Sean is taken to an apartment by Maris Conner, who previously worked for the Mullens as a caterer, along with small-time criminals Clark and Cubby Barnes and high-tech criminal Miles Roberts.
