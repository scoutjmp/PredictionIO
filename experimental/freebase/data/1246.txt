Bushwhacked is a 1995 comedy film starring Daniel Stern, Jon Polito, Anthony Heald and Brad Sullivan. Max Grabelski (Daniel Stern) is involved with delivering packages to a millionaire named Reinhart Bragden (Anthony Heald) for a $50 tip for each one. He shows up one night, delivering one at 10 PM instead of 10 AM (which the company he works for, Freedom Express, guarantees as the delivery time for all packages). Inside he finds a fire and Agent Palmer (Jon Polito) tries to arrest him for starting it and killing Bragden, but he grabs a gun and escapes. On the news, Palmer falsely names Grabelski as the suspect in Bragden's murder. He also claims that he was trying to take money that was scheduled to be taken out of circulation (which was being delivered to Bragden to be taken care of). Grabelski then finds out from his boss that another package for Bragden is to be delivered to a place called Devil's Peak. He drives up there while, at the same time, Ranger Scout Troop 12 is planning an overnighter near there. He steals a car, drives to a gas station, and meets Scout Leader Jack Erickson (Brad Sullivan), who was going to meet them there and whose Hummer he then steals at gunpoint
