It is Seagal's most successful film in critical and financial terms, including two Academy Award nominations. Under Siege was followed by a 1995 sequel, Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. The film has received a MPAA rating of R for strong violence, and for language and brief nudity. The film begins with the American battleship USS Missouri (BB-63) arriving at Pearl Harbor, where President George H. W. Bush makes a speech announcing that after the Missouri's long time service, the ship will be decommissioned in California, making the trip her final voyage. Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal), a Chief Petty Officer assigned as a cook, is preparing meals in celebration for the birthday of Captain Adams (Patrick O'Neal), against the orders of his adversarial Executive Officer, Commander Krill (Gary Busey), who is having food and entertainment brought from Hawaii by helicopter after they have set out to sea. Krill provokes a brawl in the galley with Ryback who assaults Krill.
