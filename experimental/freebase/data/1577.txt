La mort en ce jardin ("Death in the Garden") is a 1956 film by director Luis Buñuel based on the novel by Jose-Andre Lacour. Amid a revolution in a South American mining outpost, a band of fugitives - a roguish adventurer (Georges Marchal), a local hooker (Simone Signoret), a priest (Michel Piccoli), an aging diamond miner (Charles Vanel) and his deaf-mute daughter (Michèle Girardon) - are forced to flee for their lives into the jungle. Starving, exhausted and stripped of their old identities, they wander desperately lured by one deceptive promise of salvation after another. Shot in vibrant Eastmancolor and featuring a star-studded cast, Death in the Garden is an adventure film with Surrealist gestures and symbolism. Additional dialogue was written by Raymond Queneau.
