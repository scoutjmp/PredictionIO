/m/02xctk
The Big One is a movie filmed in 1996—and released in 1998 by Miramax Films—by Michael Moore during his promotion tour around the United States for his book Downsize This!. Through the 47 towns he visits, Moore discovers and describes American economic failings and the fear of unemployment of the American workers. Although much of the film features Moore unsuccessfully chasing the heads and chief executives of major corporations, he is eventually able to talk with Nike CEO Phil Knight on his company's labor practices. The successful interview is shown in the film. The movie also criticizes President Bill Clinton, and the three other major presidential candidates of the 1996 election, although it is in large part directed at Clinton's "betrayal" of progressive economic ideals. The title refers to his concept that the United States of America needs a makeover and with that a new name. When asked what that name would be he jokingly suggests "The Big One." Both the trailer and the movie poster are parodies of Men in Black.
