Raw Deal is 1986 action film directed by John Irvin and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is the story of an elderly and embittered high-ranking FBI agent (Darren McGavin) who wants to get revenge against a Mafia organization, and sends a former FBI agent (now small-town sheriff) played by Schwarzenegger to destroy the organization from the inside. On December 16, 1985, in a remote wooded cabin a mob informant with information on Luigi Patrovita, the strongest of the Chicago Mafia Dons, is being protected by FBI bodyguards. They are ambushed by a hit squad armed with automatic weapons who brutally slaughter the bodyguards and the witness. One of the agents killed while protecting the informant was Blair Shannon, son of FBI Chief Harry Shannon (Darren McGavin), who vows revenge. Small-town sheriff Mark Kaminsky (Schwarzenegger) goes home to his wife (Blanche Baker) who is angry at what their lives have been reduced to and in a drunken fit, throws a cake at Mark. Kaminsky once worked for the FBI, but five years ago he brutally beat a suspect who molested, murdered, and mutilated a young girl. He was given the option to "resign or be prosecuted" by the ambitious prosecutor Marvin
