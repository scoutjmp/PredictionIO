Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995) is an American action-comedy film, directed by Jack Baran. Its visual style and mix of humorous and violent elements are reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, whose director, Quentin Tarantino, costars. An incarcerated bank robber, Julian Goddard, escapes from prison. He is rescued in the desert by Johnny Destiny, a bizarre, possibly supernatural character. Destiny takes Julian to Las Vegas and the Marilyn Motel, owned by Harry Thoreau, who was Julian's partner in crime. Julian searches for his girlfriend, Lucille, and the proceeds of the heist. However, Destiny has taken the money and Lucille is pregnant and shacking up with Tuerto, a mob kingpin. Her agent has convinced a record label to send a talent scout to hear her lounge singing act, but Julian’s arrival upsets her plans. As they are hunted by both the police and Tuerto’s henchmen, Destiny toys with their fate. The film was released on VHS and DVD by Rysher Entertainment. The VHS version is out of print. It has not been released on Blu-ray.
