The film is rated R for crude humor, and sex-related activities. The How to Be a Player Soundtrack, released by Def Jam Recordings on August 5, 1997, featured the hit single "Big Bad Mama" by Foxy Brown featuring Dru Hill. Drayton "Dray" Jackson (Bill Bellamy) is a playboy with only one goal in his life: to have sex with as many women as possible. While he is doing that, he is busy trying to keep these women a secret from his girlfriend, Lisa (Lark Voorhies). But, Dray's sister, Jenny, (Natalie Desselle-Reid) and her friend Katrina (Mari Morrow) strategize to invite all the women Dray has been playing to the same party that he is attending. He begins to make the moves on his sister's friend, almost succeeding until the one girl he really has true feelings for shows up at the door.
