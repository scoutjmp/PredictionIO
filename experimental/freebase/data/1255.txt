Broken English (2007) is an American film written and directed by Zoe Cassavetes. Nora Wilder (Parker Posey), a single, career woman works at a Manhattan boutique hotel where her excellent skills in guest relations lack in the romantic department. If it is not her loving and dominant mother (Gena Rowlands) attempting to set her up that consistently fail, she has her friendâ€™s (Drea de Matteo) disastrous blind dates to rely on as a backup for further dismay. She's surrounded by friends who are all happily engaged or romantically involved and somehow, love escapes Nora -- until she meets an unusual Frenchman (Melvil Poupaud) who helps her discover life beyond her self-imposed boundaries. Also stars Griffin Dunne, Justin Theroux and Drea de Matteo. The film screened at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, and ultimately garnered five award nominations, among them the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. The film grossed $1,944,150 worldwide. The movie was partly filmed on location at the Chambers Hotel in midtown New York City. It was also filmed in Paris.
