Benoît Jacquot's A Single Girl (French: La Fille seule) follows a day in the life of a young Parisian woman named Valérie (played by Virginie Ledoyen) who begins a new job at a four star hotel the same day she reveals to her boyfriend that she is pregnant. The 90 minute film is shot in real time in the random style of the French New Wave. This was the breakthrough role for the 19-year-old Virginie Ledoyen, best known in America for the Danny Boyle film The Beach, and earned her a César Award nomination.
