Clark Gregg, who was working with the director on The Avengers at the time, stepped in at very short notice to play the role of Leonato, which was originally intended for Anthony Head who was unavailable. Much Ado About Nothing is the first feature from Bellwether Pictures, a micro-studio created by Whedon and his wife Kai Cole. It was shot entirely on location at Whedon's house in Santa Monica in 12 days. The film was shot in black and white by director of photography Jay Hunter, largely using hand-held cameras.
