/m/062b7h
Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult is a 1994 comedy film, the third and final film in the Naked Gun series, which was based on the Police Squad! television series. It was marketed with the tagline: "Mostly All New Jokes." The "33⅓" of the title is a reference to the speed at which long playing (LP) phonograph records (gramophone records) play. The film was originally going to be titled Naked Gun 33⅓: Just for the Record, but was changed after the studio felt not many understood the joke. It was also going to be called "The Naked Gun III: The Final Insult", according to some Christmas 1993 video previews. Leslie Nielsen returns as Lieutenant Frank Drebin (his original character from Police Squad!), along with Priscilla Presley as Jane Spencer Drebin, O. J. Simpson (in his last role before being tried for murder) as Officer Nordberg and George Kennedy as Captain Ed Hocken. Newcomers to the series Fred Ward, Anna Nicole Smith, and Kathleen Freeman co-star as a gang of bombers set to blow up the Academy Awards ceremony. Raye Birk reprises his role as the villainous "Pahpshmir" from the first film. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) has retired from Police Squad and lives a basically happy life
