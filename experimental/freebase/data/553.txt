It was written by Robert Mark Kamen, Mark Miller and Harvey Weitzman and is a remake of the 1942 Italian film Four Steps in the Clouds, by Piero Tellini, Cesare Zavattini, and Vittorio de Benedetti. In 1945, United States Army Sgt. Paul Sutton returns to San Francisco to reunite with his wife Betty, whom he married — following a whirlwind courtship — the day before he departed for the Pacific.

En route, he meets fellow bus passenger Victoria Aragon, a Stanford University graduate student whose Mexican-American family owns a vineyard in the Napa Valley.
