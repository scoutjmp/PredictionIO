Siegel, directed by Archie Mayo, written by Harry Segall (who also wrote the screenplay for Here Comes Mr. Jordan and the play Heaven Can Wait) and Roland Kibbee, and released by United Artists. The film was Mayo's last before his retirement. It starred Paul Muni, Anne Baxter and Claude Rains. The original title was Me and Satan changed by the producer when he realised that people would not see a film about the Devil. Upon release from prison, gangster Eddie Kagle (Paul Muni) is killed by his partner in crime, Smiley Williams (Hardie Albright). Kagle ends up in Hell, where "Nick" (Claude Rains) offers him a chance to get out of hell and get revenge in exchange for help with a problem. He looks exactly like Judge Frederick Parker, an upright man who is entirely too honest and liable to cause more trouble in future, since he is running for governor of his state. Kagle readily agrees. Nick arranges to have Kagle take over Parker's body. Then, funny things start happening. Kagle pursues his goal with evil intent
