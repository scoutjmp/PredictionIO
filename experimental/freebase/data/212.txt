The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a 1988 American film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Milan Kundera, published in 1984. Director Philip Kaufman and screenplay writer Jean-Claude Carrière show Czechoslovak artistic and intellectual life during the Prague Spring of the Communist period, before the Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, and detail the moral–political effects and personal consequences upon a bohemian ménage à trois: a medical doctor and his two women. The Unbearable Lightness of Being introduces Czech brain surgeon Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), a lothario who is a successful medical doctor in Communist Czechoslovakia. His lover, Sabina (Lena Olin), is an equally care-free artist. One day, Dr Tomas leaves Prague to operate on a man in a spa town. There, he meets the waitress Tereza (Juliette Binoche), who dreams of escaping her small town life. She follows him to Prague and cohabits with him, complicating Tomas's extra-domestic sexual affairs. Tomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is fascinated and jealous as she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers. Her distress about his polyamory is interrupted by the Soviet Army
