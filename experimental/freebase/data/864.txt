/m/03cygf
My Fellow Americans is a 1996 American comedy film starring Jack Lemmon and James Garner as feuding ex-presidents. Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Esther Rolle, John Heard, Wilford Brimley, Bradley Whitford and Jeff Yagher also appear in supporting performances. The film is named for the traditional opening of Presidential addresses to the American people. Originally Lemmon's perennial collaborator, Walter Matthau, was slated to co-star. However, health problems kept Matthau from appearing in the film and Garner was instead chosen to star opposite Lemmon in their only project together. Republican Senator Russell Kramer (Jack Lemmon) wins the Presidential election, narrowly defeating Democratic Governor Matt Douglas (James Garner). Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the incumbent Kramer. Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) defeats incumbent Douglas. Ted Matthews (John Heard), the Vice President under Haney, is widely seen as an idiot and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the Haney administration. A further three years later, Kramer spends his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions.
