Firestorm is a 1998 action thriller film directed by Dean Semler, and starring Howie Long, Scott Glenn, William Forsythe and Suzy Amis. The plot involves a group of Wyoming State convicts who stage an escape with the help of a smokejumper turned arsonist on the outside. The story begins when Shaye, who had stolen 37 million dollars four years previously and hidden it in the Wyoming forest, escapes from prison with five other convicts to retrieve the money. They pose as Canadian firefighters and take Jennifer (Suzy Amis), a bird watcher, hostage along the way. Jesse Graves (Howie Long) is a smokejumper, who must find a way to stop Shaye and his group of convicts and save Jennifer at the same time. The film opened to very negative reviews, receiving a Rotten Tomatoes certified fresh rating of only 5%. The film failed at the box office as well; it opened in 7th place with a paltry $3.8 million (behind six films that had all been released at least three weeks earlier) and took in only $8.1 million dollars in the United States during its theatrical run.
