/m/04gsqs_
Phat Beach is a 1996 American comedy film, written and directed by Doug Ellin, which stars Jermaine 'Huggy' Hopkins, Coolio and Brian Hooks. During a glorious Southern California summer, high school student Benny King (Hopkins) is doing time flipping burgers. Benny's father wants him to learn the work ethic, rather than have him sit around the house all summer, dreaming and writing. It's not surprising, then, that when his old friend Durrell (Hooks) comes by with a more attractive alternative, Benny jumps at it. When his family goes on vacation, Benny borrows his father's Mercedes and heads on down to the beach with Durrell. They have told themselves that they are there to sell beach-goers cheap sunglasses, but they are really there to show off their 'phat' box and attract the finest girls with portable beats on the beach. The soundtrack album for the film was released on August 7, 1996, through TVT Records and consisted primarily of hip hop and R&B music, with several other genres as well (polka, dubstep). The album reached number 40 on the Top R&B Albums chart.
