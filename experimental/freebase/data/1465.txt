Last Summer in the Hamptons is a 1995 movie directed by Henry Jaglom and released by Rainbow Releasing and Live Entertainment and features a large eclectic ensemble cast. The plot revolves around a family of theatre actors, directors, and playwrights spending their last summer together at their matriarch's (Lindfors as Helena Mora) home in the Hamptons. The summer house, mysteriously named Proskurov by Helena, is being sold as the family can no longer afford to keep it. Proskurov has been the site of an intimate outdoor theatrical performance for many summers, and the family (and Helena's interns) are preparing the final details of the show when successful Hollywood actress Oona Hart (Victoria Foyt) arrives. The film explores the dark underbelly of the family (with metaphorical help from Anton Chekhov, Aeschylus, and Tennessee Williams) as Oona attempts to attach herself to them and their theatrical endeavors as she seeks to leave Hollywood and embark on a stage career.
