Everest is a 70mm American documentary film from MacGillivray Freeman Films about the struggles involved in climbing Mount Everest, the highest mountain peak on Earth located in Himalayan region of Nepal. It was released to IMAX theaters in 1998. The 45-minute film is narrated by Liam Neeson and shot entirely in IMAX format. It includes a vivid description of the training required in order to climb, and the challenges encountered such as avalanches and lack of oxygen. This film had been in production at Everest during the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which a group of mountain climbers were trapped by a blizzard near the summit. This film contains footage of these people, as IMAX crew members interrupt filming to aid the stricken climbers.

It is the highest-grossing film that never reached the top 10 in the weekly North American box office charts, and also is the highest-grossing film never to have made the weekly top 5. The DVD was released by Miramax on December 12, 1999. It includes a 'Making Of' featurette, an extended interview with Beck
