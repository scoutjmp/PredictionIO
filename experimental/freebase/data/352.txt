/m/0bz6sq
Spice World is a 1997 musical comedy film directed by Bob Spiers, written by Kim Fuller and Jamie Curtis, and starring the best-selling pop girl group the Spice Girls. The lighthearted comedy, made in a similar vein to The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, depicts fictional events leading up to a major concert at London's Royal Albert Hall, liberally interspersed with dream sequences and flashbacks as well as surreal moments and humorous asides. The film premiered on 15 December 1997 and was released in British cinemas on Boxing Day, followed by the North American release (distributed by Columbia Pictures) on 23 January 1998. Despite it being successful at the box office, the film garnered negative reviews. However, it has since become a cult classic due to home video releases. The film begins when the Spice Girls are performing their song "Too Much" at the Top of the Pops, but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of it. The sinister newspaper owner, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphries), is attempting to ruin the girls' reputation in order to cash in on the headlines and even dispatches a photographer, Damien (Richard O'Brien), to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls.
