Two or Three Things I Know About Her (2 ou 3 choses que je sais d'elle) (1967) is a French film directed by Jean-Luc Godard, one of three features he completed that year. Like the other two (Week End and La Chinoise), it is considered both socially and stylistically radical. Village Voice critic Amy Taubin considers it one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking. The film does not tell a story so much as a present an essay-like study of Godard's view of contemporary life; Godard wrote that "I wanted to include everything: sports, politics, even groceries. Everything should be put in a film". Godard himself narrates the film in a whispered voice-over that discusses his fears to the audience about the contemporary world, including the Vietnam War. The film often cuts to various still shots of bright consumer products and ongoing construction. Like many of the director's works, the film does not follow the narrative arc of conventional cinema, with an introduction, conflict and resolution. Instead, it presents 24 hours in the sophisticated but empty life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a seemingly bourgeois married mother, part of whose life involves prostitution. Juliette
