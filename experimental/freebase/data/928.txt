The film centers on a group of four teenage girls who pursue witchcraft and use it for their own gain. The film was released on May 3, 1996 by Columbia Pictures. Sarah Bailey is a sixteen year old troubled teenager with a painful past of suicidal tendencies and hallucinations. After moving to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother to start a new life, Sarah is soon enrolled into a Catholic high school where she comes into contact with three unlikely friends: Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle. The girls all seem to be social outcasts with various problems in their lives that they wish they could fix. However, the three girls also dabble in occult practices, and when they notice that Sarah has the powers of a natural witch (a person who is naturally born with magical powers), they talk her into joining their coven. After Sarah agrees to accompany the girls in their group, they soon realize that with a fourth witch in the coven they are able to cast spells more powerful than they could before, and begin to amend all the things wrong
