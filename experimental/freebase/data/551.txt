Lord of Illusions is a 1995 American horror film, written and directed by the British author, filmmaker and artist Clive Barker. The film is based on his earlier short story, "The Last Illusion" (from Books of Blood Vol. 6), and it presents Barker's signature character Harry D'Amour onscreen for the first time. It stars Scott Bakula as D'Amour, alongside Kevin J. O'Connor, Famke Janssen and Daniel von Bargen. Barker asserts that the director's cut of this film is his definitive version, as the theatrical release does not represent his true vision. In Mojave Desert in 1982, a man named Nix (von Bargen) has gathered a cult in an isolated house. Nix calls himself "The Puritan" and has the ability to use real magic. He plans to sacrifice a young girl that he has kidnapped. While preaching to his followers, a group of former cult members–Swann, Pimm (Susan Traylor), Quaid (Joseph Latimore) and Jennifer Desiderio (Sheila Tousey)–arrive to stop Nix. After the initial confrontation with the cultists, Nix's assistant Butterfield escapes and Swann is attacked by Nix. Nix uses his powers, inducing in Swann the vision of “Flesh with a God's Eyes", causing him see his friends as monstrous
