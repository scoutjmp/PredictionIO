Booty Call is a 1997 comedy film, written by J. Stanford Parker (credited as Bootsie) and Takashi Bufford, and directed by Jeff Pollack. The film stars Jamie Foxx, Tommy Davidson, Vivica A. Fox and Tamala Jones. Booty Call is about a tender-hearted, upwardly-mobile African American named Rushon (Davidson) who has been dating his girlfriend Nikki (Jones) for seven weeks. They really like each other, but their relationship has not yet been consummated; Nikki is not so sure if their relationship is ready for the next stage. Rushon asks Nikki out to dinner, but Nikki wants it to be a double date. She brings her opinionated friend Lysterine (Vivica A. Fox), and Rushon comes with his "bad boy" buddy Bunz (Jamie Foxx). Lysti and Bunz hit it off very quickly, and to Rushon's surprise, Nikki decides it is time for their relationship to move to the next level. However, they have one small problem: this is the 90s, and everyone wants to practice "safe sex." Therefore, Rushon and Bunz must go on wild adventures trying to find "protection" before the evening's mood evaporates.
