It was produced by Rita Cecchi Gori, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, while the title role was played by Sergio Castellitto. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1953, Joe Morelli is traveling rural Sicily, offering to take screen tests of wannabe actors, for a fee. He claims to work for big Roman film studios, but he's a fraud. In one of his stops he meets a young girl, Beata, who attaches to him, despite his protestation. Their relation is evolving into a romantic one, when he's exposed, beaten and arrested. When, after serving his term, he comes back to seek Beata, he finds that the disappointment has been too big for her.
