Small Faces (1996) is a Scottish film directed by Gillies MacKinnon about gangs, specifically the Tongs, in 1960s Glasgow. It stars Iain Robertson, Joseph McFadden, Steven Duffy, Kevin McKidd, Laura Fraser, Mark McConnochie, Clare Higgins, Garry Sweeney, Colin McCredie and Alastair Galbraith. The film was produced in 1995 by Skyline Productions in association with the BBC Film Fund and subsequently released in 1996 and distributed by Path√© - a division of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The film received a BBFC Certificate of 15 (intended for audiences aged 15 and over) within the United Kingdom. Some argued that because of the high levels of violence and adult themes portrayed in this film, an 18 Certificate would have been more suitable. The film was shot on location at various districts in Glasgow, including Darnley, Sighthill, Partick, Merrylee and Bishopbriggs. The piece won the title of 'Best British Film' at the Edinburgh Film Festival.
