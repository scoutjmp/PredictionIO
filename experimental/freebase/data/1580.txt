Liebelei (1933) is a German film directed by Max Ophüls. The film, based on a play of the same name (Liebelei (German)) by Arthur Schnitzler, describes an ill-fated love affair. A love affair between a young lieutenant and a musician's daughter ends tragically when the lieutenant is killed in a duel, and the girl commits suicide. Ophüls later remade the film in France as Une histoire d'amour, using most of the original cast.
