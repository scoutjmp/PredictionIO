Demon Knight (also known as Tales from the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight) is a 1995 American horror film directed by Ernest Dickerson, starring Billy Zane, William Sadler, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Brenda Bakke, CCH Pounder, Dick Miller, and Thomas Haden Church co-star. Demon Knight is a feature-length film presented by the HBO series Tales from the Crypt, and features scenes with the Crypt Keeper (voiced by John Kassir, as in the series) at the beginning and end of the movie. The film was followed by Bordello of Blood; although it is not a direct sequel, the key artifact from this film makes an appearance. On a film set, The Crypt Keeper is attempting to direct an installment of the television show despite his disapproval of the lead actor's talent (John Larroquette). Upon becoming aware of the viewer, he proffers his latest project, which he hopes will get him into Hollywood: Demon Knight. The story begins. On a California desert road, two vehicles are engaged in a high-speed chase at night. The car in the lead is driven by a drifter named Brayker (William Sadler), who is forced to abandon the vehicle when it runs out of gas. His pursuer collides with it, causing an explosion.
