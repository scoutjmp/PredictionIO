Nine Months is a 1995 romantic comedy film directed by Chris Columbus. It stars Hugh Grant, Julianne Moore, Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, and Robin Williams. The movie is a US remake of the French movie Neuf mois and served as Grant's first US starring role. It was filmed on location in the San Francisco Bay Area. The original music score was composed by Hans Zimmer. Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner's (Hugh Grant) ideal romance with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) is turned upside-down when Rebecca gets pregnant. His fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty (Tom Arnold) & Gail (Joan Cusack) and their unruly daughters, as well as the confusing advice he gets from his perpetually single artist friend (Jeff Goldblum). Too uninvolved with Rebecca's needs, Samuel parts company with her and takes a last stab at playing the field, but when he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it's time to take responsibility before it's too late. Robin Williams, as Rebecca's Russian OB-GYN, adds much of the comic relief in the film. The film was poorly received by critics, and currently holds a 25% score on Rotten Tomatoes.
