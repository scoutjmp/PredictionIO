Deceiver, also known as Liar, or Reisser, or even BSer (UK release), is a 1997 murder mystery film. It won Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay at the 1997 Stockholm Film Festival, and the Special Jury Prize at the 1998 Cognac Police Film Festival. Textile company heir James Wayland (Tim Roth) is accused of murdering a prostitute named Elizabeth (Ren√©e Zellweger), whose body was found cut in two. The murder is investigated by tough detective Kennesaw (Michael Rooker) and his less experienced partner Braxton (Chris Penn). Wayland is a heavy drinker and compulsive liar, prone to memory losses and periods of violence. He is rich enough to access necessary information, however, and he soon learns his interrogators' own dark secrets - Kennesaw had an affair with Elizabeth to get back at his wife (Rosanna Arquette) for cheating on him, while Braxton has gambling debts with a bookie named Mook (Ellen Burstyn), who is demanding payment.
