/m/0cts7b
Shopping is a 1994 film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson about a group of British teenagers who indulge in joyriding and ramraiding. It was notably the first major leading role for actor Jude Law, who first met his co-star and future wife Sadie Frost on the set of this film. The film was located at Trellick Tower, Golborne Road, London. Channel 4 wrote a mixed review of Shopping, stating that "borrowing from Blade Runner and Gotham City to build his vision of a country divided. While a lack of subtlety clouds his intentions, the director delivers a slick, diverting story that will probably be best remembered as Jude Law's first movie."
