Having solved a high profile case involving a serial killer, Jessica Shepard (Ashley Judd) is a rising officer in the San Francisco Police Department. She is transferred to the Homicide division and promoted to the rank of Inspector. Her deceased father's former partner, John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson), serves as her proud mentor. The recently promoted Jessica finds that she might once again have to prove herself in a department that takes no prisoners. When one of her former one night stands is murdered, she and her new partner, Mike Delmarco (Andy García), are assigned to the case. Shepard, who also has a drinking problem, soon falls under suspicion. Three more murders follow, all of whom have had relationships with her. Shepard begins to experience a mental breakdown, blacking out for increasingly long periods of time. Her father, a police patrolman, had gone on a killing spree back in the 1970s and then murdered her mother. She begins to fear that she has the same violent tendencies
