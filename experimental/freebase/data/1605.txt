Love Serenade is a 1996 Australian feature film directed by Shirley Barrett. It is a comedy film which has the tagline: "Two sisters will do anything to hook the right man." There are not many characters in Love Serenade, which is set in a fictitious almost-deserted town called Sunray located by the Murray River. We're introduced to a pair of sisters, Dimity (Miranda Otto) and Vicki-Ann (Rebecca Frith), who share a house. Dimity, the shy and insecure sibling, is a waitress at a local Chinese restaurant. Vicki-Ann, the brash one, is a hair stylist. Both are looking for love, although the prospects in Sunray seem bleak, at best. That is, until Ken Sherry (George Shetsov), a thrice divorced Brisbane DJ personality, moves into the house next door. During the filming of the Silo Scene, Stuntman Collin Dragsbaek died when he fell onto a faulty airbag. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Cam√©ra d'Or. Love Serenade grossed $836,110 at the box office in Australia,.
