/m/02q7fl9
Primary Colors is a 1998 comedy-drama film directed by Mike Nichols and starring John Travolta based on the popular book of the same name (a success fueled in part by speculation over the identity of the then-anonymous author, Joe Klein). The film also starred Emma Thompson, Billy Bob Thornton, Kathy Bates, Larry Hagman, and Adrian Lester. Bates was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, and the film itself was nominated for an Academy Award for Adapted Screenplay. Jack Stanton (Travolta) is the charismatic governor of a southern state who decides to run for President. The film follows Stanton's bumbling, philandering and plotting as he rises to the top of American politics. The movie is loosely based on aspects of President Bill Clinton's life during his first run for President in 1992. Following the publication of the book in 1996, director Mike Nichols paid more than $1 million for the screen rights. At the Cannes Festival, Thompson said she did not base her film character on Hillary Clinton while Travolta said he based his on several presidents, but mostly on Bill Clinton. Director Nichols was criticized for cutting an interracial love
