/m/05dpjl
Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam (1996) is a feature-length documentary film by Nick Broomfield. It is an examination of the woman herself, Broomfield attempting to uncover if she truly is a 'horrible person', and what made her that way. The film ends up an account of the power struggle between Fleiss, another Madam named Alex, and Fleiss' former lover Ivan Nagy, himself allegedly involved in prostitution. Furthermore the destructive relationship between Fleiss and Nagy is discussed, a sort of mutual aggressiveness that both seem to find appealing. Despite positive reviews (Roger Ebert called it one of the ten best films of the year), the film did not achieve box office success. Opening at two North American theatres on February 9, 1996, it grossed $14,321 ($7,160 per screen) in its opening weekend, on its way to a final gross of just $34,402.
