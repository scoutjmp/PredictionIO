Bad Girls is a 1994 western film starring Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore. It was directed by Jonathan Kaplan from a screenplay by Ken Friedman and Yolande Turner. The story follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and a prison escape, who later encounter difficulties involving bank robbery and Pinkerton detectives. The music to Bad Girls was written by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, who composed the music as a cross between the style of his 1960s westerns and a contemporary sound. The soundtrack has been released twice; through Fox Records on 10 May 1994 and an extended, limited edition through La-La Land Records on 28 June 2011. Bad Girls was soundly panned by critics upon its release and currently holds a 9% "Rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 3.5 out of 10. The US theatrical version was released on VHS. The VHS re-release as well as the DVD contain an uncut extended version.
