Antonia's Line (Original title: Antonia) is a 1995 Dutch film written and directed by Marleen Gorris. The film, described by its director as a "feminist fairy tale," tells the story of the independent Antonia (Willeke van Ammelrooy) who, after returning to the anonymous Dutch village of her birth, establishes and nurtures a close-knit matriarchal community. Spanning nearly forty years starting just after World War II, it follows Antonia through her life, illuminating the lives of those around her - her children, community, friends, and enemies. Antonia takes over the family farm, raises a daughter (and subsequent line of women), maintains a childhood friendship with a philosopher-recluse, takes in the village simpleton, provides a home for an abused young woman who has been raped by a brother, among other humanist endeavors. The film covers a breadth of topics, with themes ranging from death and religion to sex, intimacy, lesbianism, friendship and love. It won the 1996 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice award, and the Nederlands Film Festival Golden Calf award. Filmed in Belgium.
