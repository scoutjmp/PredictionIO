Strange Days (1995)
/m/04tzz5
Strange Days is a 1995 American cyberpunk science fiction film directed by Kathryn Bigelow and produced and co-written by James Cameron and Jay Cocks, starring Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore, Michael Wincott and Vincent D'Onofrio. Despite positive reviews, the film was a commercial failure, earning only a fraction of its production cost in its domestic release. The film has garnered a cult following over the years for its dystopian and cyberpunk themes. In the last days of December 1999, Los Angeles has become a dangerously volatile war zone of crime and violence. As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the whole event is recorded by a robber wearing a 'SQUID' recorder or "Superconducting Quantum Interference Device", a device that records events directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex, which, when played back through a MiniDisc-like device, allow a user to experience the recorder's memory as if was his or her own experience. Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes), who viewed the whole thing, is a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer who deals in bootleg SQUID recordings. His main supplier, Tick (Richard Edson), tries to sell the clip to him.
