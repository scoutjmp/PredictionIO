Amityville: It's About Time (originally Amityville 1992: It's About Time) is the sixth installment to the Amityville Horror saga. It was released direct-to-video in 1992 by Republic Pictures Home Video. Lionsgate Home Entertainment and FremantleMedia North America released the film to DVD with the 1992 removed from the title in July 2005. Jacob Sterling (Stephen Macht) is an architect who has just returned home from a business trip in Amityville. Jacob lives in Burlwood, California in a suburban housing development. Jacob's ex-girlfriend, art student Andrea Livingston (Shawn Weatherly) is watching Jacob's two teenage kids, naive Lisa (Megan Ward) and troubled Rusty (Damon Martin), while he's gone. When Jacob returns, he informs them that Amityville wants his company to develop a new neighborhood with a timeless concept. Jacob has also brought home an old, mantle clock that he found in the remains of an old house in Amityville. Jacob puts it on the fireplace mantle, stating that it's "what our house has been missing". Once it's on the mantle, however, things take a turn for the worse. It turns out the clock's ticking is incredibly loud, even so it can be heard upstairs. Unknown to
