Adrenalin: Fear the Rush is a 1996 American science-fiction-action film directed by Albert Pyun, starring Christopher Lambert and Natasha Henstridge. It is set in an alternative future in 2007, where the Soviet Union has collapsed and Russia is in disarray. Out of this chaos an unknown virus covers the earth and eventually the United States. The Soviet Union has dissolved into what is now Russia. Out of the east comes a mysterious virus that kills everybody in its path. The virus eventually reaches the United States, and Boston is quarantined. A wall is established, cutting Boston off from the "mainland." All foreign immigrants are barred from entering the US since they may be carriers of the virus. The only people allowed out of the city are those with special passports, only available to those working with a government agency or through the black market. Officer Delon (Henstridge) is a mother who desperately needs to get away from the quarantined city. She is about to give her son a black-market passport to the safe-zone when she is called in to duty. A gang has been slaughtered by some kind of creature and the police are investigating. The monster has superhuman abilities
