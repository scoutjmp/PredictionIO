In the Name of the Father is a 1993 biographical film directed by Jim Sheridan. It is based on the true life story of the Guildford Four, four people falsely convicted of the IRA's Guildford pub bombings which killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian. The screenplay was adapted by Terry George and Jim Sheridan from the autobiography Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four by Gerry Conlon. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is shown in Belfast stripping lead from roofs when the security forces home in on the district with armoured cars, and the dustbin lids beat out a riot. His father later saves him from IRA justice, as they are about to kneecap him, and he is sent off to London for his own good. There he finds a squat, to explore, as he puts it, "free love and drugs." The evening when he walks off with some money from a prostitute's flat is when an explosion at a pub in Guildford kills five people (four soldiers and a civilian) and wounds 65. Conlon returns to Belfast to share his fortune. His family home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary who arrest him, and immediately place him on a military flight to the mainland UK.
