Paris, France is a 1993 Canadian comedy-drama film directed by Jerry Ciccoritti and written by Tom Walmsley. Lucy (Leslie Hope) is a frustrated erotic novelist exploring whether a weekend of sexual passion with Sloan (Peter Outerbridge), a bisexual poet, can liberate her from writer's block. The film was reviewed by Variety, and described as "a silly farce with few amusing moments and many more boring ones". And the San Francisco Chronicle noted that "the film goes as far as a non-pornographic film can go in depicting sexuality" but "Eventually you catch on that the film isn't really making fun of itself so much as making fun of the audience for watching." The film was nominated for two Genie Awards:
