/m/06v9zs
Bio-Dome is a 1996 American comedy film directed by Jason Bloom. Bio-Dome was produced by Motion Picture Corporation of America on a budget of $15 million and was distributed theatrically by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The plot of the film revolves around two clumsy, dim-witted slackers who, while on a road trip, look for a toilet stop in what they believe is a shopping mall, which in fact turns out to be a "bio-dome", a form of a closed ecological system in which five scientists are to be hermetically sealed for a year. The film has themes of environmentalism, combined with substance abuse, sexual innuendo, and toilet humor. The film stars Stephen Baldwin and Pauly Shore, and has cameo appearances by celebrities such as Roger Clinton, Kylie Minogue, Patricia Hearst, and Rose McGowan. Jack Black and Kyle Gass, more commonly known today as the band Tenacious D, first came to global attention in Bio-Dome in which they performed together as Tenacious D on-screen for the first time. The film grossed $13,427,615 in North America. Bio-Dome was universally panned by mainstream critics, some of whom named it as their pick for worst film. Bud "Squirrel" Macintosh and Doyle "Stubs" Johnson are best
