The Winter Guest (1997) was British actor Alan Rickman's debut as a director, and stars Emma Thompson and Phyllida Law. Set in Scotland on one wintry day, the film focuses on eight people: a mother and daughter, Elspeth (Phyllida Law) and Frances (Emma Thompson); two young boys skipping school, Sam (Douglas Murphy) and Tom (Sean Biggerstaff); two old women who frequently attend strangers' funerals, Chloe (Sandra Voe) and Lily (Sheila Reid); and two teenagers Nita (Arlene Cockburn) and Alex (Gary Hollywood). The film consists primarily of the interactions between the characters. The film is based on Sharman MacDonald's play, premiered at the West Yorkshire Playhouse (in the Quarry studio theatre, 23 January to 18 February 1995) before transferring to the Almeida Theatre in London (14 March to 15 April 1995). Like the film it was also directed by Rickman, starring Law, Reid, Voe and John Wark, with Si√¢n Thomas in the role of Frances, played in the film by Emma Thompson. The film was met warmly by critics, with Thompson winning an award at the Venice Film Festival.
