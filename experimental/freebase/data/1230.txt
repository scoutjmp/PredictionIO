Prêt-à-Porter (English: Ready to Wear) is a 1994 American satirical black comedy film co-written, directed, and produced by Robert Altman and shot during the Paris, France, Fashion Week with a host of international stars, models and designers. The film may be best known for its many cameo appearances and its final scene which features two minutes of nude female models walking the catwalk. Miramax considered that American audiences would not understand a French title, so they released the film in the US as Ready to Wear (Prêt-à-Porter). In other countries, the original title was used. The US DVD and VHS title was Robert Altman's Ready to Wear. Prêt-à-Porter received generally negative reviews from critics; it currently holds a 26% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film debuted poorly. By the end of its run, the film grossed $11,300,653 in the domestic box office.
